This repository contains data about how much I slept in the past months, as well as the sleeping and feeding patterns of my child. Here, you'll find the preprocessing steps I performed on the data before loading it into Tableau to create a Dashboard.

I used this Dashboard to see how much I sleep every night since my newborn was born. I also added his sleeping and feeding patterns. The goal is to one day get back to sleeping 8 hours... I don't know how long it will take. Probably a couple of years. We'll see.

## Dashboard Features

The dashboard features four distinct graphs:

- **My Sleeping Duration by Night**: How many hours I sleep every night.
- **Number of Feedings per Day**: How many times my child feeds (plotted by side).
- **Feeding Duration per Day**: How long the feedings last in hours per day.
- **Baby's Sleeping Duration by Night**: How many hours my child sleeps every night.
