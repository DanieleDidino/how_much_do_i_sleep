This repository contains data about how much I slept in the past months, as well as the sleeping and feeding patterns of my child. Here, you'll find the preprocessing steps I performed on the data before loading it into Tableau to create a Dashboard.

I used this Dashboard to see how much I sleep every night since my newborn was born. I also added his sleeping and feeding patterns. The goal is to one day get back to sleeping 8 hours... I don't know how long it will take. Probably a couple of years. We'll see.

## Dashboard Features (TO EDIT FROM HERE )

The dashboard features four distinct graphs:

- **Plot 1**: plot description.
- **Plot 2**: plot description.
- ...
- **Plot N**: plot description.
