This repository contains a set of data about how much I slpt in the last months, and the sleeping and feeding pattern of my child. Here, you'll find the preprocessing steps I performed on the data before loading it into Tableau to create a Dashboard.

I used this Dashboard to see how much I sleep every night since new newborn was born. I also added his sleeping and feeding patterns. The goal is one day to go back to sleep 8 hours...I don't knwo how long it will take. Probably a couple of years. We'll see.

# TO EDIT FROM HERE 
The dashboard features four distinct graphs:

- **Plot 1**: plot description.
- **Plot 2**: plot description.
- ...
- **Plot N**: plot description.
